# Crappy-Bird-v0.1 SYS: LINUX

*I'm sure you played this game in childhood, but on your own Phone ðŸ“² :)

*Now you don't have to use your phone, enough to use your own **PC**.
*If you wanna play crappy, you must go into /Debug folder and there's waiting exec for you :?

*As you saw in my other projects, again I've used David Barr's library graphics, called olcPixelGameEngine, website: www.onelonecoder.com .
*I bet you know how to play this game, it's not difficult to press space button hmm ðŸ¤”

**Let's take a look:**
